# Projects
Hi, my name is Imanuel Annoh. This repository showcases a collection of projects I’ve built during my journey through a Master’s program in Data Science, as well as personal explorations inspired by real-world problems. Each project reflects my curiosity, growth, and passion for applying data to solve meaningful challenges.
